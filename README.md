# Credit-Card-Fraud
Credit card fraud machine learning project in R
The project requires advanced R packages listed in required packages.

The project is an attempt to find a way to make fraud decisions for financial institutions, 

Given:
Massive dataset, highly unbalanced towards the not fraud case.

EDA:
In this section EDA was performed on the dataset with no bias in mind towards the unbalanced dataset, The findings were nooted and best features were evaluated according to the findingss.

ML:
In this section major classifiers are trained on the dataset to find a good classifier for the dataset, methods to control the bias induced due to data being unbalanced were also put in place, lastly the best model for each classifier was also evaluated.
